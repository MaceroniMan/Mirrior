# Mirrior
**Mirrior** is a 2D character evaluated language created as a just-for-fun language. It takes much of its syntax off the the language `><>` or 'fish'. 

## Difference between `><>`

**Mirrior** adds some nice-to-use features such as an easier an syntax based off of functions and special characters, instead of regular characters.

**Mirrior** also adds better stack management with entire strings able to be added as one element on the stack.

**Mirrior** has reverse-stack notation for most of the functions, making the usage much easier to use.
